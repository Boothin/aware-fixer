# Blank Plugin Template
Clone this project and it is directly importable into Eclipse. Base dependencies and file structure are set up. 

Just need to edit a few things:

Rename package, java file and MainClass in src/main/java

Edit plugin.yml in src/main/resources

Edit pom.xml in root dir

Add FTP_USERNAME and FTP_PASSWORD variables in project settings to allow automatic ftp upload of jar. Edit pom.xml to configure ftp server address.
